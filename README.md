# ArcheRage Addons

These are ArcheAge addons specifically created for the RU version of ArcheAge, found at https://ru.archerage.to/. 

They should be compatible with the NA version. They are not compatible (but usually with some effort can be ported) to Classic or AAFree. Official RU does not support Addons.

All addons should fall under acceptable use of the addon policy.


## Installation

Directly clone the repository into C:\ArcheRage\Documents\Addon or wherever your Addon folder is located. The "globals" folder is needed for all addons.

After that restart your client and enable the addons you need in character select:

## Buff Cap tracker  
Tracks your number of buffs and checks whether you are hitting the cap.  
Once you have hit the cap, any additional buffs will not be applied (songs, etc) or it will push buffs off when they should be re-applied (flame freerunner).  

## Class tracker  
Tracks the class of your target, printing the name of their skillset with an icon estimating their actual "class" (healer, tank, ...).
